            <h2>HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT, PHP, MYSQL & LARAVEL LEARNER.</h2>
            <p>I, Forhad Uddin Ahmed Mredha, always try to learn something new. last year
                I enrolled in a Japanese
                language school. I worked really hard to learn Japanese. Because of that, I was able to pass the 3rd
                level of Japanese Language
                Proficiency Test(JLPT). After that, I started searching for something new to learn. And so, I found the
                journey of web
                developing.
                I
                entered
                an institute named <b>"SmartHub"</b> it's where I learned how to code in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and PHP.


                I learned a lot of things about these languages. With the things I learned, I am making my first project
                of "Login/Logout" which is still
                not
                finished yet. In between I thought about joining <strong>"Jhankar Mahamud's"</strong> <b>"Programing
                    Hero"</b> course (5th
                batch).
                And so as planned, I finally joined the course. And from then I'm learning since... </p>
